Populating prediction results into a SQLite3 database then querying and displaying their results with Flask.

This program requires the user to input the url or path to the csv file that will be parsed. It then targets sale prices and uses other columns in the set as features to predict housing prices. It splits training and validation data to fit the models that are going to be used to take the mean absolute error in three different methods: Decision tree, Decision tree with a maximum limit of 100 and Random Forest.
