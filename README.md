This repository contains my current setup for researching vulnerabilities and exploits on
virtual machines that run vulnerable web applications and services.

### [Machine Learning (SQL/Python)](https://apl223.github.io/Portfolio/Machine-Learning/)

Projects involved:
* Training and validating models for real estate price predictions or poisonous features for mushrooms.
