### Summary

Covers common algorithms and technique that underly how modern day cryptography works.
Showcases how ransomware implements publickey or asymmetric crpytography with a Python script
that encrypts one or multiple files. Excercises involve building a server that decrypts a symmetrical key
and returns it to the victim, and extending it so that it sends a copy of the encrypted key to the server.
