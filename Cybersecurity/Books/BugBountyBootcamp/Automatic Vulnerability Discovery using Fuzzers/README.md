### Fuzzers
#
* Process of sending a wide range of values that are invalid or unexpected to trigger errors. Use these
  errors like you would with other vulnerabilities to find and validate them.
* Best performing bug bounty hunters automate most of their hacking processes, including recon.
* Fuzzing accounts for the majority of CVE entries, associated often with binary exploits.
* **Useful for finding memory leaks, control flow issues, and race conditions.**
* Web app tools: Burp, WFuzz, OWASP Zap.
* Binaries: American Fuzzy Lop
* Fuzzers could be used for specific types of input, or random input. Algorithms can also be used.
* **Web fuzzers are good for finding vulnerabilities that involve sanitization, authentication or access control problems.**
    * XSS, IDOR, SQL injections, and XXE
* When using WFuzz & Burp's intruder module, you'll have to provide different wordlists or payloads depending on the vulnerability
  your looking for.
* **Fuzzing could be used in a 4 step process:** Find data injection points for various vulnerabilities, decide on the payload, fuzz the app
  abd see the results.
* SecLists and Big List of Naughty Strings are good collections of wordlists for XSS,SQL injections, and XXE. FuzzDB is also a notable
  enumeration and vulnerability scanner.
* Bewary of throttling your fuzzers so you dont DoS.
* Careful to notice SQL injections that take longer to return, could indicate a blind vulnerability. 
  That goes for any payload that induces a time wait like sleep().
* Fuzzers could find new bug types.
 ### Fuzzing vs Static Analysis (Source code review)
 #
 * You can't tell how an application will react with static analysis
 * You won't always have the source code to review (black box testing)
 ### Pitfalls of Fuzzing
 #
 * If you don't rate limit, you risk getting banned from the service.
 * **Doesn't help much with business logic errors.**
