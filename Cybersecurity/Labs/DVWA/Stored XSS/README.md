### Security level: LOW

* Since this is in an extremely vulnerable state, we test it with a basic <script> tag with an alert function.
  It was saved onto the website, as we can see from the source code.
* Whenever I reload the page, it would repeat the alert and create more entries onto the guestbook. To avoid
  this, I would need to clear it via the form button.
